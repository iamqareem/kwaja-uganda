# /images — replaceable site photos

This folder is the single place non-developers manage site photos (e.g. via a
file browser / SFTP container pointed at this directory).

**Rule: filenames below are hardcoded into the site. Replace a file in place,
keep the exact same filename and `.jpg` extension, and the new photo goes
live on next page load. Do not rename, delete, or add files.**

Notes:
- Section backgrounds (hero, CTA band, donate, volunteer) are solid colors,
  not photos — kept that way on purpose to keep this folder small and the
  page fast. If that changes later, a developer needs to add the slot.
- Keep photos reasonably compressed (under ~300KB each) so the page stays fast.
- The gold-bordered placeholder images currently in this folder are safe to
  swap out one at a time — the layout won't break if a photo is briefly
  missing, as long as the filename is unchanged.
- If a brand-new image slot is ever needed, a developer needs to add it to
  the HTML/CSS first — this folder only swaps existing slots.
